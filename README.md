# KahootSolver

**Kahoot Solver** is a parser for non-live Kahoot tests, made to easily get finished Kahoots and getting rewards😏

Solver loggins into a test as a random fake name, gets questions and answers for them by parsing the HTML page, then refreshing a page and logging by a user-provided name, solving the test with the correct answers.
